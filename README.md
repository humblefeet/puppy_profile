# puppy_profile

To be fair, this is the first time in awhile I've used Bootstrap. 

In my last company, where we used SASS for our products, we did not use a CSS library and created all of our UI from SASS. So most of my job was editing and maintaining these files. 

This assessment was a good lesson in using and then customizing the SASS that Bootstrap provides.
